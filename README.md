# 3DRPGTutorial
3D RPG Tutorial based on YT series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgOlnRASuCw

I might have changes some names of Nodes / variables, so this is not a 100% copy of the tutorial. I also didn't make torches to emit particles and there is a bug with attacks, where basically collider can enter the opponent twice during the attack (in fact, as a Player, you can kill a monster without even attacking it, if you run into the Monster with the sword pointing towards it :D ). Lasstly, I was not really following the folder structure from the tutorial.

Anyway, these are all small changes, the main goal of this repository is to provide a reference, where you can quickly copy-paste a bigger parts of code without the need to re-write it. Plus, this project also gives you the opportunity to check the setup of nodes to find the difference between your Scene and mine.
